# VSCode AI Rules

This project uses enterprise-grade, technology-agnostic development patterns for all AI-powered development tools in VSCode, including:
- GitHub Copilot Chat
- IntelliCode
- Other VSCode AI extensions

## Quick References

- **Project Guidelines**: See `CLAUDE.md`
- **Agent Patterns**: See `AGENTS.md`
- **Detailed Rules**: See `agents/rules/*.mdc` files
- **Available Skills**: See `agents/skills/` directory

## Core Rules for VSCode AI Assistants

### 1. Security-First Development
- Validate ALL user inputs with appropriate schema validation
- Implement secure authentication flows with proper session management
- Apply rate limiting to public API endpoints
- Use role-based access control for authorization
- Never expose sensitive data in error responses or logs
- Reference: `agents/rules/security.mdc`

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 80% coverage of business logic
- Integration tests: 15% coverage of API/database interactions
- E2E tests: 5% coverage of critical user journeys
- All business logic must have appropriate tests
- Reference: `agents/rules/testing.mdc`

### 3. Type Safety & Validation
- Use strong typing available in your chosen language
- Implement runtime validation at API boundaries
- Apply schema validation to all form inputs and API requests
- Reference: `agents/rules/core.mdc`

## Agent Delegation Pattern

When implementing features, follow the agent patterns from `AGENTS.md`:

- **FrontendAgent**: UI/Design components, accessibility, responsive layouts
- **BackendAgent**: API routes, business logic, authentication
- **DatabaseAgent**: Schema design, migrations, data access patterns
- **TestAgent**: Testing strategy, coverage, test organization
- **SecurityAgent**: Security patterns, input validation, access control
- **ReviewerAgent**: Code quality, performance, accessibility compliance

## Technology Stack Adaptation

These rules apply regardless of your chosen tech stack. Adapt them to your specific framework:

### Frontend
- **React/Next.js/Vue/Svelte**: Component-based with proper state management
- **Angular**: Component + service architecture
- **Traditional**: Server-side rendering with progressive enhancement

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Express, Fastify, or framework-specific patterns
- **Python**: Django, FastAPI, Flask with ORM patterns
- **Go**: Gin, Echo, or similar frameworks
- **Other**: Adapt patterns to your chosen framework

### Database
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL, MySQL with ORM/migrations
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, DynamoDB with document validation
- **Cloud**: Firebase, Supabase with row-level security

## Critical Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

1. **Input Validation**: ALL user inputs must be validated with schema validation
2. **Authentication**: Implement secure, tested authentication flows
3. **Rate Limiting**: Public endpoints MUST have rate limiting
4. **Authorization**: Role-based access control with proper checks
5. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in errors
6. **Database**: Use ORM/ODM patterns, avoid raw queries
7. **Testing**: All business logic must have appropriate test coverage
8. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for user-facing components
9. **Documentation**: Keep README, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md updated
10. **Performance**: Monitor bundle size, implement lazy loading, optimize assets

## Code Quality Standards

- **Type Safety**: Strict typing, no loose type usage
- **Readability**: Clear names, proper documentation, logical organization
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms, appropriate caching
- **Maintainability**: Modular design, separation of concerns, SOLID principles

## When to Reference Each File

- **CLAUDE.md**: For architecture decisions and technology stack guidance
- **AGENTS.md**: For agent responsibilities and when to delegate
- **agents/rules/*.mdc**: For specific implementation patterns:
  - `core.mdc`: Core principles and architecture
  - `security.mdc`: Security patterns and best practices
  - `testing.mdc`: Testing strategy and patterns
  - `frontend.mdc`: Frontend development patterns
  - `database.mdc`: Database and data access patterns
  - `style.mdc`: Code style and formatting guidelines
- **agents/skills/**: For reusable domain-specific implementations

## For More Information

Explore the `agents/skills/` directory for domain-specific guidance on common tasks:
- Each skill provides specific, actionable guidance
- Reference skills when implementing similar features
- Skills build on the core rules above

All AI assistants in VSCode should follow these rules consistently to maintain code quality, security, and maintainability across the project.
