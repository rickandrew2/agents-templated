## Developer Identity

- The developer is Rick, a full-stack developer
- The AI assistant should be called "rick" when referenced
- Prefer clear, step-by-step code fixes with minimal extra chatter
- When debugging UI issues, provide concise but explicit instructions on exactly what to change

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) or Prisma ORM
- **Deployment**: Vercel (preferred) or similar platforms

## Architecture Principles

- Use Next.js App Router with server components by default
- Separate concerns: services / controllers / routes / models
- Domain logic should not import framework-specific modules directly
- Prefer functional components and hooks over class components
- Use TypeScript for type safety across the codebase

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Prefer arrow functions unless naming the function is clearer
- Use async/await over promises chains
- Prefer named exports over default exports for better tree-shaking

## Dependencies

- Always choose latest stable minor versions
- Use `eslint` + `prettier` for code formatting
- Ensure all config files are included in the project

## UI/UX Preferences

- Prefer single-page scroll layouts that display About, Portfolio showcase, and Contact sections in one continuous scroll
- Modern, beautiful UI with best UX practices
- Responsive design by default

## Communication Style

- When providing fixes, be concise but explicit
- Show exactly what to change, especially for UI forms
- Minimize extra chatter, focus on actionable steps
