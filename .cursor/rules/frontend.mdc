## Next.js App Router

- Use Server Components by default
- Only use "use client" directive when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Leverage Server Actions for form submissions and mutations
- Use Route Handlers for API endpoints when needed
- Implement proper loading and error states with `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx`

## React Patterns

- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Extract complex logic into separate utility functions or hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props and state

## Component Structure

```typescript
// Good: Named export with TypeScript
export function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component logic
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Avoid: Default exports
export default function ComponentName() { ... }
```

## Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Prefer Tailwind over custom CSS when possible
- Use `@apply` sparingly, only for repeated patterns
- Organize classes logically: layout → spacing → typography → colors → effects
- Use responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) for mobile-first design

## Single-Page Scroll Layout

- Implement smooth scrolling between sections
- Use semantic HTML5 sections (`<section id="about">`, etc.)
- Create a navigation component that scrolls to sections
- Ensure proper spacing and visual hierarchy between sections
- Consider using Intersection Observer for scroll animations

## Form Handling

- Use React Hook Form for form state management
- Implement proper validation with Zod or similar
- Show clear, step-by-step error messages
- Provide immediate feedback on user actions
- Use Server Actions for form submissions in Next.js

## State Management

- Use React state for local component state
- Use Context API for shared state across components
- Consider Zustand or Jotai for complex global state
- Avoid prop drilling beyond 2-3 levels

## Performance

- Use `next/image` for optimized images
- Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
- Lazy load components below the fold
- Optimize bundle size by analyzing imports
- Use React.memo() for expensive re-renders when needed
