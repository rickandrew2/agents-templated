# Cursor Rules - Technology-Agnostic Development Template
# This is a flexible development template that adapts to any technology stack with enterprise-grade patterns.
# Detailed rules are in agents/rules/*.mdc files - refer to those for implementation patterns.

## Developer Identity & Communication
- AI assistant should provide clear, step-by-step solutions with actionable examples
- Focus on security, performance, and maintainability in all recommendations
- Adapt patterns to the chosen technology stack

## Core Principles
- **Security-first development**: Always validate inputs, authenticate users, implement appropriate rate limiting
- **Type safety**: Use strong typing systems available in chosen language/framework
- **Performance optimization**: Monitor resource usage, implement caching, optimize assets
- **Testing strategy**: Comprehensive testing at unit, integration, and E2E levels
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all user-facing interfaces
- **Documentation**: Keep project documentation updated and comprehensive

## Architecture Principles
- **Technology-agnostic**: This template adapts to your chosen stack
- **Security patterns**: Input validation, authentication, authorization, rate limiting
- **Performance patterns**: Caching, lazy loading, bundle optimization
- **Testing patterns**: Unit (80%), Integration (15%), E2E (5%) coverage target
- **Feature-oriented structure**: Group by domain/feature, not just technical layer

## Security Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Input validation**: All user inputs MUST be validated with appropriate schema validation
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication flows with session management
- **Rate limiting**: Public endpoints MUST have rate limiting protection
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with proper middleware
- **Error handling**: Never expose sensitive data in error responses
- **Database access**: Use ORM/ODM patterns, avoid raw queries unless performance-critical

## Code Quality Standards
- **Type Safety**: Use strict typing, avoid loose type usage
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle/binary size, implement lazy loading patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for user-facing components
- **Testing**: All business logic and user flows must have appropriate tests
- **Documentation**: Keep README, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md updated

## Technology Stack Adaptation
Choose your stack and apply these patterns consistently:

### Frontend Options
- **React/Next.js/Vue/Svelte**: Component-based with proper state management
- **Angular**: Component + service architecture with TypeScript
- **Traditional**: Server-side rendering with progressive enhancement

### Backend Options  
- **Node.js**: Express, Fastify, or framework API routes
- **Python**: Django, FastAPI, Flask with proper ORM patterns
- **Other**: Adapt patterns to your chosen backend technology

### Database Options
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL, MySQL with ORM (Prisma, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy)
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, DynamoDB with ODM patterns
- **Cloud**: Supabase, Firebase, managed database services

## Agent Delegation (See AGENTS.md for details)
- **UI/Design work** → FrontendAgent
- **API/Business logic** → BackendAgent  
- **Database/Schema** → DatabaseAgent
- **Testing implementation** → TestAgent
- **Security reviews** → SecurityAgent
- **Code quality** → ReviewerAgent

## Usage Instructions
1. Choose your technology stack
2. Adapt the patterns in agents/rules/*.mdc to your chosen technologies
3. Update this .cursorrules file with stack-specific details
4. Begin development following the established patterns
