🚀 Excited to share: I just published my first npm package!

📦 agents-templated - A technology-agnostic development template with AI assistant integration

After spending countless hours setting up new projects with the same patterns (security, testing, AI configs), I automated it.

What it does:
✅ Scaffolds enterprise-grade project templates
✅ Works with ANY tech stack (React, Vue, Python, Go, etc.)
✅ Pre-configured for Cursor & GitHub Copilot
✅ Built-in OWASP Top 10 security patterns
✅ Comprehensive testing strategies
✅ Selective installation (only get what you need)

Install & use:
npm install -g agents-templated
agents-templated init --all

Perfect for:
- Starting new projects quickly
- Standardizing team codebases
- Onboarding new developers
- Ensuring security best practices

This project taught me a lot about:
- Node.js CLI development
- NPM package publishing & distribution
- Developer experience design
- Open source best practices

GitHub: https://github.com/rickandrew2/agents-projects-templated

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! 🙌

## ✅ Step 3: Tweet It (5 minutes)

**Tweet 1 (Main announcement):**
```
🚀 Just published my first npm package: agents-templated!

Enterprise-grade development templates for ANY tech stack
✅ AI assistant ready (Cursor, Copilot)
✅ Security-first (OWASP Top 10)
✅ Works with React, Vue, Python, Go, etc.

```

**Tweet 2 (Problem-solution):**
```
Tired of spending hours setting up:
❌ Project structure
❌ AI configs
❌ Security patterns
❌ Testing strategies

I built a CLI to automate it: agents-templated

npm install -g agents-templated
agents-templated init --all

https://www.npmjs.com/package/agents-templated

#BuildInPublic #DevTools
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Dev.to Article (10 minutes)

Go to https://dev.to/new

**Title:** "I Built and Published My First NPM Package: agents-templated"

**Tags:** npm, javascript, opensource, devtools

**Body:**
```markdown
# I Built My First NPM Package: agents-templated

## The Problem

Every time I started a new project, I spent 2-3 hours on:
- Setting up project structure
- Configuring AI assistants (Cursor, Copilot)
- Implementing security patterns
- Setting up testing strategies

And it was different for every tech stack! 😤

## The Solution

I built **agents-templated** - a CLI tool that does all of this in 30 seconds.

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g agents-templated
agents-templated init --all
\`\`\`

## Key Features

✅ **Technology-Agnostic** - Works with React, Vue, Python, Go, ANY stack
✅ **AI-Ready** - Pre-configured for Cursor & GitHub Copilot
✅ **Security-First** - OWASP Top 10 patterns built-in
✅ **Selective Installation** - Only install what you need

## How It Works

\`\`\`bash
# Install globally
npm install -g agents-templated

# Navigate to your project
cd my-project

# Install everything
agents-templated init --all

# Or install selectively
agents-templated init --docs --rules
agents-templated init --github
\`\`\`

You get:
- AGENTS.MD (development patterns)
- CLAUDE.md (project guidelines)
- AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md (AI assistant setup)
- agents/rules/ (6 development rule files)
- agents/skills/ (reusable agent skills)
- .github/copilot-instructions.md (GitHub Copilot config)

## What I Learned

Building this taught me:
- **Node.js CLI development** with Commander.js
- **NPM publishing workflow** (including 2FA!)
- **User experience design** for developer tools
- **Open source best practices**
